# Vehicle-Sales-Analysis

# Project Overview

This project is my 4th project and I chose to focus on vehicle sales for this project because it offers a rich dataset that reveals significant insights into product performance and customer behaviour. By analysing sales data, I aimed to showcase my skills in SQL and Tableau while demonstrating the practical applications of data analysis in driving business decisions. The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, and the analysis focuses on sales data to uncover valuable insights into product performance, seasonal trends, and customer behaviour using RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value). This project is designed for prospective employers to review my technical capabilities in data analysis and visualisation.

# Project Highlights
Various SQL operations were performed, such as data aggregation, grouping, and ranking to analyse the data.
Key insights include the highest revenue-generating products, the best-performing years and months, and reviewing customer behaviour using RFM analysis.
The Tableau dashboard provides visual insights into the sales data, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret key trends (interactive features can be seen at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/riajul.hussain).

# Key Insights from the Analysis
- Top Revenue-Generating Product- Classic cars generated the most revenue for the company.
- Best Performing Year- The year 2004 was the company's most successful year in terms of revenue generation.
- Most Profitable Deal Size- Medium-sized deals contributed the highest revenue.
- Monthly Sales Trends- November consistently was the best month for sales, possibly due to shopping discounts in this period.
- Geographical Sales- The United States was the companyâ€™s largest market with the highest number of sales.
- RFM Analysis- Showed that customers with low RFM scores were highly valuable and should be targeted for retention.

# Recommendations for Improving Vehicle Sales
Based on the insights gathered from the data, the following strategies are recommended to improve vehicle sales:
- Focus on classic cars as this product generates the highest revenue, increasing marketing efforts for this product line can drive further growth. The company can also consider expanding the classic car inventory or introducing related accessories to boost sales.
- Medium-sized deals offer the highest revenue, so prioritising customers in this range through targeted promotions and special offers can maximise returns.
- Since November is consistently the best-performing month, launching special sales campaigns or discounts in the lead-up to this period could further increase revenue.
- While the United States is the largest market, exploring emerging markets with a targeted product mix could diversify revenue streams and reduce dependency on a single market.
- Based on the RFM analysis, customers with low RFM scores (high value) should be engaged with loyalty programs or personalised discounts to increase their lifetime value.

# Future Improvements
- Use data visualisation to present how customer behaviour is monitored.
- Integrate machine learning models to show future sales based on historical data.

# Summary
Top Product- Classic cars generated the most revenue across all years.
Best Year- The company's best year for sales was 2004.
Customer Behaviour- RFM analysis showed the most valuable customers that purchased frequently and recently.
